Client <br>
The client for this survey is a grocery store that uses online shopping and delevery to deliver products to users.
By answering the above questions, the client can change the way the incentives for customers can be given, 
and increase traffic and revenue. The investigation may prompt which product could be offered in a strategic location, 
so customers can increase their spending in store. We can find ways to motivate customers to return and buy more products.
